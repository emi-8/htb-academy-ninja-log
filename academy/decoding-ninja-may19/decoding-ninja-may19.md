## 🧠 Challenge Overview

This HTB Academy module involves decoding a deeply encoded string using web proxy tools and pattern recognition. The goal is to decode step-by-step and recognize encoding techniques often used in bug bounty or CTF scenarios.

The challenge emphasizes:
- Identifying multiple encoding layers
- Using built-in decoding tools (Burp Suite Decoder)
- Optionally using CyberChef to test and chain decoding operations

### 🔐 Input String

**Input:**
VTJ4U1VrNUZjRlZXVkVKTFZrWkdOVk5zVW10aFZYQlZWRmh3UzFaR2NITlRiRkphWld0d1ZWUllaRXRXUm10M1UyeFNUbVZGY0ZWWGJYaExWa1V3ZVZOc1VsZGlWWEJWVjIxNFMxWkZNVFJUYkZKaFlrVndWVmR0YUV0V1JUQjNVMnhTYTJGM1BUMD0=

## 🔍 Decoding Steps

### Step 1 – Base64 Decode ×4
- Noted the padded `==` ending (indicator of Base64)
- Decoded recursively until readable string appeared

Result after decoding:

JTQ4JTU0JTQyJTdiJTMz...

### Step 2 – URL Decode
- Recognized the format `JTxx` → corresponds to `%xx` in URL encoding
- Decoded to plain ASCII using Burp Suite Decoder and CyberChef

## ✅ Final Output

Successfully revealed a flag in the format: `HTB{*****}`  
(The full flag has been omitted to avoid spoilers.)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Layered encodings** are common in web challenges and must be peeled back systematically.
- Tools like **CyberChef** are highly effective for chaining decoding operations.
- Recognizing visual encoding cues (like `=`, `%`, or `JT`) is essential for quick analysis.
