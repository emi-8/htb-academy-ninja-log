# HTB & THM Writeups

This repository documents my journey through Hack The Box challenges, Academy labs, TryHackMe rooms and CTF-style machines. These writeups reflect my personal learning process and may include mistakes, evolving techniques, or early-stage thinking.

The goal is to deepen my understanding of real-world cybersecurity concepts through hands-on practice, pattern recognition, and consistent documentation.
